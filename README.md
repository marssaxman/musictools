This is a collection of experiments with music information retrieval and audio
processing algorithms, which will eventually grow to include machine learning
and algorithmic composition processes.

I am looking for ways that automated music analysis creates opportunities for
small, novel, focused, semi- or fully-automated tools which could assist a DJ
with library curation, track preparation, remixing, and possibly even live
performance. Music production is less of an immediate concern, but if I have
enough success making remix tools, they will inevitably grow in that direction.
